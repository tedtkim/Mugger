Additional comments:

- I used ALAssetsLibrary+CustomPhotoAlbum category for creating a custom photo album for
  my app.  Link: http://www.touch-code-magazine.com/ios5-saving-photos-in-custom-photo-album-category-for-download/
  Note: I modified the completion block signature to contain the NSURL for photo image
  as well.

- In MugsCDTVC.m, using UIActionSheet's showFromBarButtonItem: for iPad was a
  surprisingly difficult task.  Mainly, presenting an action sheet from the master view
  of a split view controller via BarButtonItem would make it slide up from the bottom
  like showInView.  This was particularly strange because presentPopoverFromBarButtonItem
  worked flawlessly (see image picker popover presentation in MugsCDTVC.m) in either
  orientation, and was using the same bar button item as target.  
  
  It appears Apple considers this as two popovers (one being the master view in portrait 
  mode), which violates HIG.  After hours of research and consideration, I decided to
  keep the simple solution which maintains usability and works for landscape, since
  potential solutions were not very elegant.
  
- Using CIImage's autoAdjustmentFiltersWithOptions, I apply apple's auto adjustments
  (which includes filters like CIFaceBalance, CIVibrance, CIToneCurve, 
  CIHighlightShadowAdjust, etc) and present the user with an option to use it.
  
- Core Image and UIKit share different coordinate systems, and took awhile to get 
  correctly.

- If the mug is cut off at the bottom, mouth position gets affected.  I looked into 
  possible scaling/transform issues, but with eyes being correct and size of annotated
  image as expected, it appears it's simply CIDetector unable to adjust for edges at
  bottom.  I'd welcome feedback if you know a solution!
