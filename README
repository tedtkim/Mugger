Additional comments:

- Please make sure to play around with the different features.  There are gesture 
  recognizers in ScoreDetails ShowMuggersViewControllers, and some are different in
  iPhone vs iPad.  Users and mugs can also be swiped to delete from the table cells.

- I used ALAssetsLibrary+CustomPhotoAlbum category for creating a custom photo album for
  my app.  Link: http://www.touch-code-magazine.com/ios5-saving-photos-in-custom-photo-album-category-for-download/
  Note: I modified the completion block signature to contain the NSURL for photo image
  as well.
  
- I am completely using auto layout for both iPhone and iPad, and mugger is a fully
  universal project.  For UI purposes, it is better geared for the larger iPad screen.
  To accomodate tight vertical space in landscape iPhone view, I moved the title label
  to the view controller title itself, and added edit title as a bar button item.
  
- There are some subtle UI elements that make the viewing more pleasant.  There is a 
  bottom UIView that acts as a container for the iPad with a lighter background color,
  with increasing transparency in landscape mode so that the photo isn't chopped off.
  
- I struggled with transforms for a great deal of time on this project - some photos
  not taken by the native camera get a bit skewed.  I enlisted the help of numerous 
  sources but was ultimately unsuccessfuly.  UIImagePickerControllerCropRect didn't
  always cooperate :(.
  
- For iPhone, it would help to have activity indicators as toggling between original and
  auto-enhanced photos take a noticeable amount of time.  I was focusing on my iPad 
  device, and ran out of time before I realized the sluggishness.

- I used UITextView Height sizing code referenced from a StackOverflow post:

- In MugsCDTVC.m, using UIActionSheet's showFromBarButtonItem: for iPad was a
  surprisingly difficult task.  Mainly, presenting an action sheet from the master view
  of a split view controller via BarButtonItem would make it slide up from the bottom
  like showInView.  This was particularly strange because presentPopoverFromBarButtonItem
  worked flawlessly (see image picker popover presentation in MugsCDTVC.m) in either
  orientation, and was using the same bar button item as target.  
  
  It appears Apple considers this as two popovers (one being the master view in portrait 
  mode), which violates HIG.  After hours of research and consideration, I decided to
  keep the simple solution which maintains usability and works for landscape, since
  potential solutions were not very elegant.
  
- Using CIImage's autoAdjustmentFiltersWithOptions, I apply apple's auto adjustments
  (which includes filters like CIFaceBalance, CIVibrance, CIToneCurve, 
  CIHighlightShadowAdjust, etc) and present the user with an option to use it.
  
- Core Image and UIKit share different coordinate systems, and took awhile to get 
  correctly.

- If the mug is cut off at the bottom, mouth position gets affected.  I looked into 
  possible scaling/transform issues, but with eyes being correct and size of annotated
  image as expected, it appears it's simply CIDetector unable to adjust for edges at
  bottom.  I'd welcome feedback if you know a solution!
  
- In ShowMuggerViewController, I learned that shouldPerformSegueWithIdentifier:sender: is
  not called when doing a manual segue or manual unwind. This was useful as I had to put
  logic for not repeatedly calling popovers elsewhere.
